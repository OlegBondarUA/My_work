        "comment": "Oh I didn't catch that it happened shortly after the Bas Rutten fight.\n\nHonestly I don't think You should be pissed at anybody over the fact that Kohsaka never won the Openweight. (But I still understand your pain)\n\n1) The title was only in Worked matches for about 18 months.\n\n2) RINGS was a promotion that had trouble picking a good direction.\n\nThey managed to outdraw **Pancrase and Shooto** during it's entire time but with **Pride** coming it was going to be very difficult. And then you add Maeda to the mix who is a borderline maniac... mistakes were inevitable.\n\nI should be angry that Tamura got buried because he's my hero but somehow... I'm not. I'm not because He managed to be very Successful in a period where we had guys like the **Three Musketeers** and the **Four Pillars**\n\nKohsaka is a different thing, I believe he made his debut 2 years too late but hey... from the 5 years he wrestled, he proved to be one of the greatest athlete in Shoot-Style History. That's a huge accomplishment in my eyes.\n\nYears later he proved that he still got it with his matches in NJPW and U-STYLE. (Seriously his 2nd match with Nagata is great). \n\nHe could have pursued a good PW career as a Main Eventer but he chose to stay in MMA.",
